# WSsensor
Arduino library sensor receive signals used by WS8707 weather stations sensor, using remote 433MHz low cost module.

Development can be read in http://domotica-arduino.es/foro/Thread-Integrando-WS8707-sensor-temperatura-humedad-en-Excontrol-Arduino

It may be compatible with the WS8426 (temperature only) More economical.
I could not see if it's true.
